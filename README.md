# QR Code Generator

## Overview
This project is a simple web-based QR code generator. Users can input any text or URL, and the application will generate a corresponding QR code that can be displayed and saved.

## Features
- Generate QR codes based on user input.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.
- Simple and easy-to-use interface.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the web page and making it responsive.
- **JavaScript**: For handling the logic to generate QR codes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/qrcode-generator.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd qrcode-generator
   ```

3. **Open the `index.html` file** in your browser:
   - Double-click the `index.html` file.
   - Or use a local server (e.g., [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in VS Code).

### Usage
1. **Enter the text or URL** you want to encode into the input field.
2. **Click the "Generate QR Code" button**.
3. The QR code will be generated and displayed below the input field.
4. You can right-click the QR code to save the image.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that includes the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: Contains the CSS styles for the project.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for generating the QR code. *(Optional if you split the JavaScript into a separate file)*
- `README.md`: The file you're currently reading.

## Troubleshooting
- **QR Code not generating?** Make sure there is no typo in the JavaScript code, specifically `classList` in the `generateQR` function.
- **Image not displaying?** Ensure that your `style.css` file has the appropriate styles for showing the image.
